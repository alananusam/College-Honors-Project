This project explores facial recognition using two complementary approaches that highlight both adaptability and robustness.

The first approach focuses on real-time facial recognition by training a model on live-captured data. By collecting around 100 frames of a personâ€™s face on the spot, the system can quickly personalize itself for new users, offering flexibility in dynamic or small-scale environments.

The second approach is built on a pre-trained model using the FER2013Plus facial image database. This method leverages a large and diverse dataset to achieve reliable facial recognition across a wide range of individuals, making it well-suited for larger or more standardized applications.

Together, these two models demonstrate a balanced facial recognition system that combines the immediacy of live training with the strength of pre-trained database models. This project highlights the versatility and potential of modern facial recognition technologies in different use cases.
